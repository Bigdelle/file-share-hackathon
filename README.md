File-sharing system for Cornell hackathon using Google Cloud

For the Cornell Hackathon, I am using the Google Cloud credits in order
to create a file sharing system that can be used by any organization. 
I want to be able to add permissions to certain people, and I have to look 
into keys that can be made for specific users (if this is possible on google cloud).
