File-sharing system for Cornell hackathon using Google Cloud

For the Cornell Hackathon, I am using the Google Cloud credits in order
to create a file sharing system that can be used by any organization. 
I want to be able to add permissions to certain people, and I have to look 
into keys that can be made for specific users (if this is possible on google cloud).


If you want to run this somewhere that isn't my computer make sure flask is installed and google cloud is
authenticated properly. Then make a virtual environment and do all your work through that.

Note*** Theres a lot of "garbage" files that I have in here that aren't actually super useful to the final project.
It's just stuff I did before realizing theres a cooler/better way to do it. My organziation could definitely be better,
but it was also a hackathon and I didn't really have time to be meticulous and clean.
